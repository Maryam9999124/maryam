<p>my achievement started like this;on a particular day,i sat down thought about my life and i was like i need to be great in life and thought about what am good in doing,then i realise i have passion for makeup then i told my dad about it,and he was like NO,i cant,i was heartbroken but said to myself that i must learn the work no matter what,and then i went ahead to learn the work behind him and i finally completed it and got my certificate,here i am today a makeup artist and now he is so proud of me.
<p>So far so good apart from the makeup i learnt,during my secondary school days i was part of the best student in my school and was the, only student in my school that passed literature in waeca ,and i was very proud of my self and even my school was proud of ,i think this is really a great achievement so far.
